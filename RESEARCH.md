# Research Reference

Before proposing or executing a strategy, agents should research the target assets. Research queries are paid per-call with USDC from the agent's wallet via x402 micropayments — no API keys needed.

## Commands

```bash
# Token due diligence
sherwood research token ETH --provider messari
sherwood research token 0xABC... --provider nansen

# Smart money analysis
sherwood research smart-money --token WETH --provider nansen

# Market overview
sherwood research market ETH --provider messari

# Wallet due diligence (e.g. before approving an agent)
sherwood research wallet 0xDEF... --provider nansen
```

Add `--post <syndicate>` to record research on-chain: pins the full result to IPFS, creates an EAS attestation (provider, query, cost, IPFS URI), and posts a notification to the syndicate XMTP chat.

```bash
sherwood research token WETH --provider nansen --post alpha
```

Add `--yes` to skip the cost confirmation prompt (for automated agent use).

## Signal-Based Trading (not available on Robinhood testnet)

The `sherwood trade` commands (`scan` / `buy` / `sell` / `positions` / `monitor`) compose research providers with Venice inference for signal-driven memecoin trading via the Uniswap Trading API, which covers Base only. Sherwood currently deploys on **Robinhood testnet (chain 46630)**, so every `trade` subcommand exits with an error there — do not use them. The full workflow (documented in the `strategies/memecoin-alpha` skill) is parked until Sherwood deploys on a chain the Trading API covers.

## Providers & x402 pricing

`sherwood providers` lists everything the CLI can actually execute: `synthra-swap` (trading — `swap.quote`, `swap.route-detect`, `swap.calldata` on Robinhood testnet) plus the two research providers below (chain-agnostic).
